Abstract:

Automatic Document Indexing of an unstructured document involves cherry picking of words from various parts of the 

document and classifying them. Research has proposed Statistical and linguistic methods, Machine learning, neural-

networks, self-organizing maps and connectionist models.Among the linguistic methods, natural language processing 

libraries have enabled semantic interpretaion of index candidates. In the absence of other input in terms of mark-ups, 

metadata or punctuations, the index candidates could be picked up based on cluster and outliers to the topics presented in 

the text. To detect semantic relevance of the words, we can use concept hierarchy structures such as from WordNet. In a 

set of related words representing a cluster and all other things considered equal, we will pick the one appearing in the 

text with the highest frequency.


Design:

I propose a single table with the record of all words occuring in the document and their attributes. Attributes will 

include The table will have the following columns words, their offsets and page numbers, frequency, tags and emphasis 

etc.candidates will be unigrams. 

Classifier logic could be written in separate modules to determine the clusters and outliers in the above table. 
 
Tables will be implemented as skip-lists in memory for fast traversal, insert and update.

Document parsing and population of the table is the first step.

Clustering and index selection is the next step



Advantages:
The index selected will be semantically organized and connected.

Disadvantages:
The index selected will be single word representations
